# 🚀 Data Engineering Project

Welcome to the **Data Engineering Project**!  
This project focuses on building a robust and scalable data pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data from multiple sources into a centralized data warehouse for analytics and reporting.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project aims to:
- Collect data from APIs, databases, and flat files.
- Perform necessary transformations and cleaning.
- Load the processed data into a data warehouse like **Amazon Redshift**, **Google BigQuery**, or **Snowflake**.
- Schedule workflows using **Apache Airflow**.
- Monitor pipeline performance and data quality.

- **Extract**: API, CSV, JSON, Databases
- **Transform**: Data cleaning, formatting, aggregation
- **Load**: Insert/Upsert into Data Warehouse
- **Tools**: Airflow, Spark, dbt, Python scripts

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-engineering-project.git
cd data-engineering-project
```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure your environment variables in `.env` or the `config/` directory.

4. (Optional) Start with Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## 🚀 Usage

- To run the ETL job manually:

```bash
python etl/main.py
```

- To run through Airflow:
    - Start Airflow webserver and scheduler
    - Access the DAGs UI and trigger the workflow
